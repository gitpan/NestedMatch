README for NestedMatch version 1.03

NestedMatch finds delimited substrings with proper nesting.  For example,

  ($lispexpr, $rest) = nested_match ("(defun () (let ...)) (defun ...)",
                                     "(", ")");

returns ('(defun () (let ...))', ' (defun ...)');

For more detail, see the POD documentation in NestedMatch.pm

PREREQUISITES

NestedMatch is a simple module with just two functions.  
It has no requirements beyond Perl 5.000.

INSTALLATION

This module is written entirely in Perl.  There's nothing to build,
and installation should be as simple as
 
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

To install this module by hand, as is required for Win32 Perl 5.003,
simply copy NestedMatch.pm to the \perl\lib\Text directory.  Test
by running perl test.pl.

CHANGES

1997/10/21: Released version 1.03
            No substantive changes, just a few tweaks in the documentation.
            And I'm finally going to get this thing up to PAUSE.

1997/06/27: Released version 1.02
            Aurg^2!  1.01 had bad line breaks (^M characters confuse
            MakeMaker, I guess).

1997/06/27: Released version 1.01
            Aurg!  nested_match didn't do the right thing if $start eq $end
            and the search string didn't begin with $start.  Now it does.

1997/06/27: Released version 1.00

TODO

I haven't been tempted to change it in weeks, so I think it's complete
and stable as is, but feel free to disagree ;-)
